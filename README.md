## **About The Course**

In this first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will:

- Gain an understanding of the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning.
- Become familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning.
- Build, train, and apply fully connected neural networks from shallow to deep versions.
- Implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks.
- Identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture.
- Apply deep learning to your own applications.

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for you to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to your work, level up your technical career, and take the definitive step in the world of AI.
